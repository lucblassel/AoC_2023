# Advent of Code 2023

Doing AoC this year again.  

Puzzles are [here](), I have not included the inputs in this repo, you can add your inputs in an `inputs` directory, with files named `inputs/day-01.txt`, `inputs/day-02.txt`, ...

These are organized in a single Cargo workspace, so to run a specific day you can use `cargo run --bin day-01`.
