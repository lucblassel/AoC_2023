# Advent of Code 2023

Doing AoC this year again, but trying not to limit myself to the standard library and use popular crates whenever I can. 

Puzzles are available [here](https://adventofcode.com), I have included my inputs, but you can replace them with yours if you want to try out these solutions *(just be sure to also modify the tests for each day that take check against the solution for my input)*.

These are organized in a single Cargo workspace, so to run a specific day you can use `cargo run --bin day-01`.
